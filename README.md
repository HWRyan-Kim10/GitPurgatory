2.1
- The init() method in the Git.java class initializes a Git repository. The method, in order, creates the git directory if it doesn't already exist, creates the objects directory inside git directory if it doesn't already exist, creates the index file inside the git directory if it doesn't already exist, then creates the HEAD file inside the git directory if it doens't already exist.
    - and if-else statement at the end then checks whether the repository was created and can print "Git Repository Created" or if all directories and files already existed and instead prints out "Git Repository Already Exists"

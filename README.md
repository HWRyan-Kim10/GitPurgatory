# GitPurgatory
2.1
- The init() method in the 'Git.java' class initializes a Git repository. The method, in order, creates the git directory if it doesn't already exist, creates the objects directory inside git directory if it doesn't already exist, creates the index file inside the git directory if it doesn't already exist, then creates the HEAD file inside the git directory if it doens't already exist.
    - if-else statement at the beginning of the method checks whether the repository was created and can print "Git Repository Created" or if all directories and files already existed and instead prints out "Git Repository Already Exists"
- TESTER: In 'public static void main' there is a for-loop. Inside of the for-loop, 'System.out.println' tells you which cycle you are on. Next, 'Git.init()' calls the init() method that is in 'Git.java'. Next, the verifyInit() method that is in GitTester is called and it checks to see if all the files and directories that should've been made exists and if it does it prints "Initialization Verified: PASS". If even one file or directory does not exist when it should "Initialization Verified: FAIL" gets printed instead. Finally the cleanup() method is called which deletes the files that were created by running the tester. It does so by calling the delete() method on the git directory. This method checks to see if the method that is trying to be deleted actually exists first and then checks to see if what's trying to be deleted is actually a directory. The delete method is then called on each child of the directory being deleted with a for-each loop causing complete deletion of the directory and its contents through recursion. Once finished the cleanup method prints "Cleanup complete". 

2.2
- The method encryptThisString performs a SHA1 hash on whatever string is the input and I pulled it from the following link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/sha-1-hash-in-java/
- The method sha1FromFile takes the path of the file that you are trying to hash and converts the contents into a string (it does so by using the encryptThisString method). I learned about the readString method at this link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/files-class-readstring-method-in-java-with-examples/ 
- I made shaone.txt for the tester of these two methods. Inside of shaone.txt is the word shaone so I compared the output of the sha1FromFile method to the sha1 string converter link provided on the assignment.

2.3
- At the beginning of createBlob, the method checks to see if the objects directory exists under the git directory to make sure that it has a place to store the blobs. The sha1FromFile method is then called and a new blobFile with the hash as its name goes under the objects directory. Inside the try catch the method checks to see if the blobFile already exists and if it doesn't it calls the copy content method. This method copies the contents of the initial file to the blob file and I found this method on this link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java/different-ways-to-copy-content-from-one-file-to-another-file-in-java/
- In the tester resetForRetest() was made to perform cleanup and then make sure simple test files were created for each test loop (hello.txt and world.txt). This is done by using the new createTestFile method which uses file writer. The method verifyBlobExists checks if a blob file for a given file path exists inside git/objects. It first confirms the objects folder is there, then calculates the SHA-1 hash of the file’s contents using Git.sha1FromFile. That hash is the expected filename of the blob. Finally, it prints PASS if the blob file exists, or FAIL if it doesn’t. 

2.4
- In the updated version of the project, I made a few key changes across both the Git and GitTester classes to make the workflow feel more complete. In the Git class, I added an addToIndex method that records each file’s SHA-1 hash alongside its name in the git/index file. The method was written to keep the file clean by avoiding trailing spaces or extra newlines and it uses buffered streams so it stays straightforward and reliable. In the GitTester class, the tests were expanded so they do more than just check initialization and blob creation. The tester now creates sample files, runs them through createBlob and addToIndex, and then verifies that the index contains the correct hash-to-filename mappings. A new resetWorkspace method was also added which clears out everything from previous runs, including the git folder and the test files, and then sets up a fresh repository with an empty index.

2.5
- hashOfTree(List<String> entries): creates a "tree" file with the entries provided, returns the hash of that tree file
- returnSortedWorkingList(List<String> workingList): sorts workinglist based on depth and alphabetically, returns sorted list
- subPath(String path): returns the subpath for the file
- treeFromIndexx(String filepath): creates workinglist, sorts the working list, goes through the working list and combines the top groups of files into their respective subfolders, sorts it and repeats until workinglist size = 1 or when only the root tree is left- returns the root tree as "tree hash projectname"
